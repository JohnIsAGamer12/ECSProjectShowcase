# ECSProjectTemplate

This is a small personal project done in an Audit class that uses ENTT (Entity Component System) as a deeper dive into how it works and I did it while building a small Top Down Mini Game where you play as a turtle and shooting a Cactus that multiples into smaller versions of itself into groups until there is no more.

## What does this Project Use?

1. ENTT (An Entity Component System)
2. CMAKE (A Cross-platform tool used to manage the build process of software.)
3. C++ (Programming Lanaguage)
4. Vulkan (Graphics API For Renderering)
5. Gateware (3D Math Library)

## Instructions on how to Build the Project

1. Clone it or Download the .ZIP from GitHub Website or Desktop **If you download the .ZIP Unzip it somewhere on your dekstop or in a folder.**

3. Once you have the project on your Desktop, open the command prompt and we will now build the project to do this Input in this in a Comand Prompt.
```
cmake -A x64 -S ./ -B ./Build
```

*You can do this command with out the '-A' command as it's optional depending on what your operating system is, CMAKE will automatically know what operating system you have*

3. Go into the Build folder that was created by CMAKE, and Go into the Solution folder and The Code is there to viewed at.
4. Build the Game by going to Where you can set the Build Version between Release or Debug, and go the "**Build Tab**" and build the Solution (*You can also use the 'CTRL-SHIFT-B' Shortcut to Build the Project as well*).
